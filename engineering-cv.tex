\textbf{Lead DevOps Engineer,} GS-Studio -- Remote \hfill July 2024 -- Present \\
\vspace{-9pt}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Led team of 3 engineers; owned milestone planning, platform technical vision, and mentorship
  \item Implemented quality gates for code and content; introduced ratcheting to prevent warning growth; reduced code warnings from ~5,000 to ~2,700 (including 250 critical); cut content warnings from 250 to 30 (88\%)
  \item Introduced Unreal Engine ecosystem tools: UnrealGameSync, Horde, RoboMerge, BuildGraph, Cloud DDC
  \item Reduced build sync times from 15 min to 1-5 min (67-93\%) via Unsync integration
  \item Cut UnrealGameSync Precompiled Binaries (PCBs) sync times from 15 min to 7 min (53\%) via Horde analytics and Perforce tuning
  \item Integrated GitOps with ArgoCD. In conjunction with RenovateBot automated dependency updates, keeping infrastructure modern, secure and up-to-date
  \item Built observability stack (logging, metrics, tracing, alerting); resolved critical k8s API, unroutable message, and disk I/O issues; enabled teams to monitor latency, throughput, saturation, and availability
  \item Guided instrumentation of server-side services with OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and custom metrics
  \item Implemented supply chain security: SBOM, provenance, artifact signing, signature verification
  \item Designed system to provision backend services for game servers on-demand, reducing development infrastructure costs by 67\% (3x) and provisioning time from 10 min to 30 sec (95\%)
